1. b. P1: 0 - 64,000;
	  P2: 0 - 64,000
Explanation: Each process has its own virtual address space and the virtual address space can be mapped to any physical address space in memory by operating system. Hence both processess can have 0 to 64k as their initial virtual address space.

2. The possible states a process may be at any point in time are:
a. Created/New : When the process is created it is in the Created or New state.
b. Ready : The process that has been loaded in the memory and has been waiting for the execution is said to be in the ready state.
c. Running : When the process is choosen for the execution is said to be a running state. A process can sun either in the kernel mode or user mode.
d. Blocked : A process is said to be in a blocked state when it cannot carry on without external state change. For example, if a process is waiting for a user input, it is in the bloceked state until user enters a value.
e. Terminated : A process is terminated when either the process running is completed or it is killed explicitly. In either case the process is in the terminated state.

3. write takes approximately 4 times more than printf.

4. printf bufferes its output and often stores its output in memory buffer. This buffering helps printf run faster than the write.
